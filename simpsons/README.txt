this program uses the the simpsons 1/3 rule to integrate tabulated data. depending on spacing data the program will use either the trapaziod rule, the regular 1/3 rule, the composite 1/3 rule or the composite 1/3 rule with the trapazoid rule for the last segment. the required inputs are vectors of the x and y variables where the x values must be evenly 
spaced.
